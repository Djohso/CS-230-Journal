Module 8 Journal for final Software Design Document

Questions to Answer:


Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The gaming Room Client is a development team that is planning to release an online picture-guessing game.  This game will be cross-play, available on multiple different devices with differing Operating Systems.
  The software that will run this program must be capable of translating between different systems, allowing for the required online communication between various platforms.  Additionally, the software must be capable of storing users and 
  user information, as well as having a single game instance at a time, with different teams within that game instance.  Each team must allow for several players to be stored for each team.


What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  My reccomendations and presentation of information through this documentation was done well.  I believe that my explanations and reasoning for my suggestions are well thought through, 
  and written in such a way that makes my thought process easy to follow and understand.  My analysis of the information I found was a strong point in my documentation.



What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  I found it helpful to categorize different aspects of the project to make it easier to organize thoughts and research.  By compartimentalizing things like client side experience, server capabilities, 
  etc., It makes it easier to summarize the benefits and detriments of the different options, and thus makes it easier to summarize the benefits and detrimetns of different strategies and systems as a whole.
  Additionally, the organization of each aspepct makes it easier to follow thought processes, since a reccomendation can make reference to a previous finding in a section earlier in the document.



If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I would choose to revise my research and findings for each system.  I would like to improve my research by including sources, and additional tangential information that may be relevant to each system.  
  Having more extensive and tracable research for each Operating System would as a whole make the documentation more professional,  allow for reccomendations to be examined by outside parties, and add the ability to scrutinize
  the reliability of source material for the reccomendations by accessing the original source and examining where the information came from.




How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I interpreted the user's needs as requiring the software to have cross-platform capabilities, which lead me to research somewhat into APIs.  It is important to consider the user's needs
  when designing software because in the end, the whole project is being funded by, and being catered to, the client's wishes.  Regardless of what may seem like a decent add on or a different direction that may seem beneficial, 
  the needs and wishes of the client come first.  This is why it is so important to make sure you not only know what the clients want to have in their software, but also how you should prioretize their needs for the software.  Being able to 
  know what functions to prioretize may make the process of designing the software go a bit more smoothly, if you are ensuring the key parts of the client's needs are being met in a timely manner, rather than being pushed to the side and 
  leaving the client wondering about the software they requested.





How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  I approached designing software by confirming what the goal of the software was in the beginning.  By having a clear goal set for how the program should function, that makes it easier to break down the project into smaller
  parts to make sure that each piece will fit together to satisfy the original goal.  In the future, I can supplament this strategy by adding in research on similar software, to get a better idea about how my project may look when it is complete, as
  well as giving me strategies to use in my projects.  I would also like to use in line comments to date, classify, and label addons to the software, which will help me document how I create or improve the code over time, which can also be used for future projects   as a resource when I need reference.
